# Versioning Policy

## Overview

## Versioning Rules
- **MAJOR version** increments represent backward incompatible changes to the ABI or to the storage layout of the contracts.
- **MINOR version** increments represent new features that are backward compatible.
- **PATCH version** increments represent backward-compatible bug fixes.

## Release Process
- New versions are proposed and discussed in GitHub Issues.
- Contributors must update the version number in relevant files as part of their pull requests.
- Version updates are reviewed and merged by the project maintainers.

## Changelog
- A changelog will be maintained in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) to document all notable changes in each version.
